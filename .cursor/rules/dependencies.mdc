For managing dependencies and installing new packages we use 'uv' from Astral.
You have access to the 'uv' docs but core syntax is:

### Adding deps

'uv add requests' is like 'pip install requests'

#### Specify a version constraint
uv add 'requests==2.31.0'

#### Add a git dependency
uv add git+https://github.com/psf/requests

'uv remove requests' is for removing deps from the project

#### Using --dev

If you want to install something that should be available only for developers of the library add --dev to the command. Like 'uv add --dev requests'

WARNING:
1. NEVER DO 'uv pip install'
2. NEVER USE pip
3. Forget about pip
